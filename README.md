# UniversalGP
UniversalGP: Simple generic implementation for Gaussian process models

The code was tested on Python3.6 and TensorFlow1.5

The code mainly forked from [AutoGP: Automated Variational Inference for Gaussian Process Models](
https://github.com/ebonilla/AutoGP). However, there are some differences and improvements.

1. Specify the inference method in the model setting, including variational inference and the simplest
exact inference only for standard Gaussian process model (1 dimensional output and Gaussian likelihood)

2. Improve and adjust some codes to TensorFlow running more smoothly
