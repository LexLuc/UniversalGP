## Inference function

Specify the inference method in the model setting, including 
   variational inference, leave-one-out inference, exact inference, fair variational inference and a baseline logistic regression.

   * Variational inference can be used for generic Gaussian process 
     models (multi-input, multi-output, regression and classification) 
     with black-box likelihood.

   * Leave-one-out inference can be used for generic Gaussian process 
     models (multi-input, multi-output, regression and classification) 
     with Gaussian likelihood.

   * Exact inference can be only used for standard Gaussian process 
     model (one dimensional output) with Gaussian likelihood.
     
   * Fair variational inference can be used to achieve fair classification based on gerneric Gaussian process
   
   * Logistic regression is used as a baseline
